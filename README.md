# Python heatmap

SVG county map : http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:USA_Counties_with_FIPS_and_names.svg

This program creates US Heat Map. First Download the svg county map from wikimedia. Each counties have its own path,styly, and color. This program fill color for each county based on result.

Note:
I am using data that has Zips instead of Fips, So i needed to change the zips to fips. Also data has some invalid data, they all being cleaned as well.
